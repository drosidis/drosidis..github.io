# About me
Hello! My name is Yannis. I am a hands-on CTO, a passionate full stack web developer and an entrepreneur at heart. I have 15 years of experience
as a fullstack web-developer. I have worked with many technologies and in many different sectors. I have helped several startups launch
their products and become successful.

My expertise goes beyond coding. I am very effective in architecting web apps, hiring devs, leading a small tech team and driving the product.

# Founded

In 2016 I co-founded and became CTO of [DeepStream](https://www.deepstreamtech.com), an eProcurement and pre-qualification web platform for engineering companies in the Oil & Gas sector. Things that I'm proud of:
- We raised Â£1.5M and grew the company to 12 people
- We got accepted at [TechStars Energy](https://www.techstars.com/programs/energy-program/)
- As a CTO, I was responsible for architecting and scaling our product.
- I hired and led a very strong engineering team.
- I contributed a very large part of the codebase using Javascript, Angular, Node, MongoDB, AWS.
- I engaged in all stages of growing DeepStream from being an idea on a piece of paper to a fully functional company.

# Other start-ups

In January 2019 I joined [BoxMind](https://www.theboxmind.com), a company that provides fitness classes in the B2B sector. At the time the team relied
on a combination of WordPress plugins and external SaaS services for their operations. I was the first in-house developer and took on the task of architecting
and building their web app. It was launched in June 2019 and serves as the base of their operations.

Our stack is React, Node, MongoDB, AWS.

MVP a few months later.
