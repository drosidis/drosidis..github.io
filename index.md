# About me
Hello! My name is Yannis. I am a hands-on CTO, a passionate full stack web developer and an entrepreneur at heart.

In 2016 I co-founded my own startup, [DeepStream](https://www.deepstreamtech.com), an eProcurement and pre-qualification web platform for engineering companies in the Oil & Gas sector.

Before and after that, as a CTO, I helped [Aquanetix](https://www.aquanetix.co.uk/) and [BoxMind](https://www.theboxmind.com) launch their product and get the first users onboard.

My expertise goes beyond coding. I am very effective in architecting web apps, hiring devs, leading a small tech team and driving the product.

# Coding skills
Currently my preferred tech stack includes:
- JavaScript (ES6) and TypeScript
- React, redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- AWS (EC2, Beanstalk, S3, SNS etc)
- SCSS

Last but not least, throughout the years I have done my fair share of coding with Java, Angular 2+, MySQL, Android, Ruby and others.

I live in London and love to make new connections. Feel free to contact me:
